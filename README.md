# Targeting Improved Cotton Through Orbital Cultivation (TICTOC)

**Abstract:** Introduction/Background: Roots play roles in a host of plant functions that are critical to cotton yields, stress resilience and its impact on the environment, through their activity in processes such as water uptake, nutrient usage, and soil carbon sequestration. Previously, Park et al., (2005) created cotton plants that over-express the vacuolar proton pumping pyrophosphatase (AVP1-OX). These plants show increased salt and drought resistance with more than a 20% increased fiber yield under stressful conditions that normally severely limit cotton productivity. These plants also develop a larger root system that can explore a wider and deeper volume of soil for water and nutrients. Such exploration patterns are inextricably linked to gravity, which directs the growth of the main and lateral roots via modulation of e.g., auxin signalling. Supported by CASIS UA-2018-276.

#### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

TIC-TOC (Targeting Improved Cotton Through Orbital Cultivation) is a project by the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison's Gilroy Life Science Lab that compares cotton grown in space to cotton grown on Earth. The lab's research focuses on how plants sense and respond to their environment, and how these signals regulate plant development. The lab uses advanced microscopy techniques, biochemistry, and molecular biology to address biological questions like how plants respond to spaceflight. The TIC-TOC mission, launched aboard the SpaceX Dragon during its 22nd Crew Resupply Mission to the International Space Station (ISS), represents a significant advancement in agricultural sciences and plant biology. This mission centers around a cutting-edge technology demonstration of the genetically modified organism (GMO) AVP-OX, aimed at uncovering new methodologies for improving plant resilience against two critical environmental stressors: drought and salinity.
